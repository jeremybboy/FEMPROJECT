# Finite-element-method-WEEK2

The aim is to compute :

-Laplacian(u)=f
u=g (at the border)

we will build the solution. 
we take/choose the function "u" (example u=sin(aax)sin(bby)
we can then calculate Laplacian(u) (2nd derivative) =f


Download the w2.zip, it will download all the file needed. 


/Write "make" in the Terminal 

Construction of a mesh square 10*10 

/Write ./EF2d Th.msh
we obtain convergence in 2 iterations.


Open gnuplot from the terminal with the command "gnuplot"
/Write splot "gp" 1:2:3 w l
we obtain the figure given in the file
